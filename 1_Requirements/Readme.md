# Requirements
## Introduction
 * Project is based on idea of circuit analyzer.
 * It will basically solve problems related to basic RLC circuit.

## Research
* There is no precise C program on this topic .
* Hence , I decided to to build a program which can help students to solve problems very quickly. 
## Cost and Features
| Time | Features | Cost |
| ---- | -------- | ---- |
|15 hr | analyzer | Zero |
## Defining Our System
* The system will prompt user to give the input.
* Base on input provided and type of circuit chosen,system will analyze the circuit.
* After analysis the system will display output in a format in which user is interested.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
