# Requirements

## Introduction
 * Project is based on idea of circuit analyzer.
 * It will basically solve problems related to basic RLC circuit.

## Research

### Circuit Analysis
* A Circuit is a collection of interconnected components.
* Circuit analysis is the process of finding the voltages across,and the currents through ,all network components.
* In this Project we asssume components to be linear in nature.
* There is no precise C program on this topic .
* Hence , I decided to to build a program which can help students to solve problems very quickly.
 
### Equivalent Resistance
* The equivalent Resistace is where the aggregate resisitance connected either in series or parallel is calculated.
* Electrical resistance shows how much energy one needs when you move the charges/current through your devices.
* The equivalent resistance of a network is that single resistor that could replace the entire network in such a way that for a certain applied voltage V you get the same current I as you were getting for a network.

### RLC Circuit
* An RLC circuit is an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor(R), an inductor(L), and a capacitor(C), connected in series or in parallel.
* The resistor is used to reduce the peak resonant frequency.
* Resistor increases the decay of oscillations ,which is also known as Damping.
* RLC circuits have many applications such as oscillator circuits, radio receivers and television sets etc.
![Description]()

### Resonance
* The resonance of a RLC circuit occurs when the inductive and capacitve reactances are equal in magnitude but cancel each other beacuase they are 180 degrees apart in phase. 
* An ability of circuit to resonate at specific frequency known as Resonance frequency.
* The resonance frequency is defined as the frequency at which the impedance of the circuitis purely resistive.

### Star and Delta Conversion
* Star and Delta connections are the two types of connections in a 3-phase circuits.
* The transformation is used to establish equivalence for networks with three terminals.
* It allows us to convert impedances connected together in a 3-phase configuration from one type of connection to another.
