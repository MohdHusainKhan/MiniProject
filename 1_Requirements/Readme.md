# Requirements

## Introduction
 * Project is based on idea of circuit analyzer.
 * It will basically solve problems related to basic RLC circuit.

## Research

### Circuit Analysis
* A Circuit is a collection of interconnected components.
* In this Project we asssume components to be linear in nature.
* There is no precise C program on this topic .
* Hence , I decided to to build a program which can help students to solve problems very quickly.
 
### Equivalent Resistance
* The equivalent Resistace is where the aggregate resisitance connected either in series or parallel is calculated.
* Electrical resistance shows how much energy one needs when you move the charges/current through your devices.
* The equivalent resistance of a network is that single resistor that could replace the entire network in such a way that for a certain applied voltage V you get the same current I as you were getting for a network.

### Star and Delta Conversion
* Star and Delta connections are the two types of connections in a 3-phase circuits.
* The transformation is used to establish equivalence for networks with three terminals.
* It allows us to convert impedances connected together in a 3-phase configuration from one type of connection to another.

## Cost and Features
| Time | Features | Cost |
| ---- | -------- | ---- |
|15 hr | analyzer | Zero |
## Defining Our System
* The system will prompt user to give the input.
* Base on input provided and type of circuit chosen,system will analyze the circuit.
* After analysis the system will display output in a format in which user is interested.
